## Main Features

- Get new waveform based on run ID and build level
- Create tag and enter comments to annotate a specific waveform
- Save a tag and comments with a waveform
- Delete a tag and therefore the comments and waveform with it
- Pan and view different parts of the visualization
- Box zoom in and out of the visualization
- Wheel zoom on x-axis
- Save the visualizations locally
- Interaction is synced between the first 2 graphs and between the last 2 graphs \(e.g if you box zoom in the first graph, the second graph will do the same\)
